    "## 2. Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Aerodynamic drag plays a pivotal role in shaping the performance and efficiency of vehicles, particularly within the automotive and aerospace industries. Traditionally, the prediction of aerodynamic drag relies on time-consuming and computationally intensive simulations, posing challenges for swift design iterations. However, the development of the concept of AI4Science presents a completely new opportunity for data mining and knowledge discovery, namely the possibility of mining and discovering real-world physical fields from large amounts of simulated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://ai-studio-static-online.cdn.bcebos.com/8f8a45fa13ba49e1b86d17e35d29f5932a488f03ada149aaac2c3e7826567a3c)\n",
    "\n",
    " The aerodynamic characteristics of an automobile play a pivotal role in enhancing energy efficiency, diminishing wind-induced noise, curtailing emissions, and advancing towards the objective of carbon neutrality. Nevertheless, the conventional methodology of developing aerodynamic performance is heavily dependent on the expertise of engineers for model updating and validation. This approach engenders substantial redundancy in model handling, particularly during the verification of individual component designs, and the coupled computational time further exacerbates the overall efficiency. Moreover, a wealth of simulation data accumulated by automobile design manufacturers often remains untapped in the context of new design propositions.\n",
    " ![](https://ai-studio-static-online.cdn.bcebos.com/f084b6edca54400da7df0185924ea3341d4c966da8154263b3739f15e04e5199)\n",
    " \n",
    "In the specific design process, during the CAS (Computer Aided Styling)  phase of automobiles, engineers need to identify noise sources by examining the velocity and pressure cloud diagrams from CFD fluid simulations during the calculation of aerodynamic drag and wind noise. The modeling improvements mainly target air separation points, thereby proposing optimization schemes in a targeted manner. Rapid prediction of flow field information and drag coefficients can accelerate the iteration efficiency of automobile design. By hosting this competition, it can promote technological innovation in related fields and boost the application of AI in the engineering field. The results of the competition are expected to significantly improve the efficiency of automobile design, shorten the time-to-market for new models, and bring both economic and environmental benefits to the automotive industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://ai-studio-static-online.cdn.bcebos.com/ed6124ee4a264a90ad88b412c1e39c804d56dc99b8eb47cd9df6e108fa507891)\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, aerodynamic drag has become one of the hot issues in the current automotive design field, especially in the era of pure electric vehicles, it affects the cruising range. Conducting research on rapid prediction methods for drag coefficients can assist in quickly defining and screening models during the design stage, simultaneously improving the evaluation efficiency of optimization schemes, and saving computational resources to a certain extent.\n",
    "To illustrate, consider a standard aerodynamics dataset featuring 3D vehicle geometries with Reynolds numbers reaching as high as five million. Traditional numerical methods demand O(10^3) seconds to compute vehicle surface pressure, a crucial parameter for calculating aerodynamic drag. In contrast, ML can discern relationships between design parameters (e.g., shape, surface features) and aerodynamic drag through training on simulation data. Once trained, the ML model can rapidly predict aerodynamic drag for new designs in O(10^-1) seconds, markedly curtailing computational resource requirements.\n",
    "The impact of this advancement extends beyond automotive and aerospace realms, resonating across industries where aerodynamics holds paramount significance. From wind energy applications to architectural designs and sports equipment development, the swift and precise prediction of aerodynamic drag harbors transformative potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, a critical consideration is the generalization capability of ML models. Typically, a trained ML model may falter in making accurate predictions when faced with changes in the vehicle's geometry. To address this concern, we propose the Rapid Aerodynamic Drag Prediction for Arbitrary 3D Vehicle challenge, emphasizing the generalization capability of ML models. Whereas, most of existing ML models and competitions often overlook the importance of evaluating generalization on arbitrary datasets."

    "\n",
    "Car Pressure: This refers to the distribution of air pressure around the vehicle. When a car moves, it has to push air out of the way. This creates areas of high pressure in front of the car and areas of low pressure behind the car. The pressure difference can cause aerodynamic forces which can affect the car’s performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Drag: This is the resistance that a car experiences when moving through the air. Drag is directly influenced by the shape, size, and ‘smoothness’ of the car, as well as the speed at which the car is traveling. The higher the speed, the greater the drag. High drag means the engine has to work harder to maintain speed, which can reduce fuel efficiency. Automotive designers and engineers work to reduce car drag in order to increase a vehicle’s speed and fuel efficiency.\n",

Only by ensuring accurate velocity field information can we conduct precise analysis of physical phenomena such as streamlines, vortex tubes, and pressure distribution, and then propose effective optimization schemes. The velocity field serves as the foundation for all analyses, and its accuracy directly affects the effectiveness of design optimization and the ultimate efficiency of automobile design.
